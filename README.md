### Hello World 👋👋👋

🦾 As an Associate Director of Data Science, I bring over a decade of experience in leading data science initiatives, driving innovation, and delivering actionable insights across diverse industries. My expertise spans advanced analytics, Machine Learning, NLP, and Statistical modeling. I have successfully overseen portfolios for major clients in Healthcare & Life Sciences, Telecom, Retail and Manufacturing, implementing scalable AI-driven solutions that have significantly enhanced Customer Engagement, Omnichannel Orchestration, Personalization, and Revenue growth. My technical leadership and strategic planning have consistently resulted in measurable improvements, such as a 30% boost in customer satisfaction and $18 million in total growth.

🚀 In my current customer-facing role at Axtria, I led a team of high-performing data scientists and machine learning engineers, optimizing resources and performance management. I have a strong track record in architecting and deploying machine learning pipelines and models, leveraging tools such as Python, SQL, XGBoost, TensorFlow, and AWS. I have driven significant advancements in Likelihood Prediction, Fraud Detection, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Customer Churn, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Recommendation Systems, Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. My ability to manage complex projects and collaborate with cross-functional teams has been pivotal in generating substantial revenue and enhancing operational efficiency.

🔭 Looking forward, I aim to transition into senior role where I can further leverage my skills in stakeholder management, algorithm development, and large-scale data analysis. With a robust foundation in machine learning infrastructure, cloud computing, and software engineering best practices, I am well-equipped to tackle complex challenges involving Big Data and Distributed Computing, and deliver innovative solutions that drive business success. My certifications in Google Cloud and TensorFlow, along with a solid background in Deep Learning and AI, position me as a valuable asset for any forward-thinking organization.

✌️ Strong believer in Collaboration, Responsible AI, Diversity and Inclusion.
